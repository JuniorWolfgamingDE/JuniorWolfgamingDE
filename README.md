## Hello, I'm Nino.
I create Minecraft mods, packs, plugins etc. Anything the heart desires!

I'm currently mainly working on fixing issues in older mods for Minecraft version 1.12.2, and am trying to (re-)maintain a moderation system for Minecraft.
If you haven't noticed yet, I like cats. Like, a lot. And Hatsune Miku. And if you wanna stalk my taste in music, feel free to visit my [Last.fm profile](https://last.fm/user/juniorwmg).

Dear Microsoft gods of GitHub, please make pushes to forks show on my activity meter, it majorly pisses me off that they don't.

You can reach me either by adding me on Discord (@juniorwmg), or sending an [e-mail](mailto:juniorwmg@lolcatz.de?subject=Contact%20via%20GitHub).
